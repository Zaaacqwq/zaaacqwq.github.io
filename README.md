# Zaaacqwq's Portfolio

This portfolio is a showcase of my projects and skills, featuring interactive visual elements built with Three.js, particles.js, and custom canvas animations. It's built using Vite and React, designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Three.js Visualizations**: Interactive 3D elements that enhance the visual experience.
- **Particles.js Effects**: Dynamic particle systems for background effects.
